Depending on what evidence is introduced during the trial, it could be rough for the entire crypto industry.\n\n\u201cHow much damage can this trial do to the already beaten-down reputation of the industry at this point?\u201d asks Yesha Yadav, a law professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cThis trial is going to be an excruciating moment for the industry because no one knows what kind of evidence might come out.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried, the founder of FTX and Alameda Research, is facing seven counts of criminal charges: two counts of wire fraud, and five counts of conspiracy charges. FTX was a failed cryptocurrency exchange founded in 2019. According to a now-deleted profile from FTX investors Sequoia Capital, FTX was founded because of Bankman-Fried\u2019s frustration with other exchanges when he was running Alameda Research, his crypto trading firm.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T14:00:29+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nSBF\u2019s trial has started, this is how he and FTX got here\n\nThe highly anticipated criminal trial for Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, started Tuesday to determine whether he\u2019s guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy. And as one former federal prosecutor put it: \u201cThe odds seem to be stacked against him at this point.\u201d\n\nThe 31-year-old co-founded FTX in 2019; within a few years the once third-largest crypto exchange\u2019s valuation hit $32 billion at its peak. It\u2019s now trying to claw back any funds to distribute to creditors.\n\nBut how did the once third-largest crypto exchange get here?\n\nBefore FTX, Bankman-Fried co-founded crypto-trading firm Alameda Research in 2017. He co-founded FTX in 2019 as a complement to Alameda, to help bring in revenue and liquidity for the trading arm.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: SBF\u2019s trial starts soon, but how did he \u2014 and FTX \u2014 get here?\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T14:00:29+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) alongside the criminal charges. Wang and Ellison plan to cooperate with prosecutors and will be major witnesses in the trial, given their close ties to Bankman-Fried, FTX and Alameda.\n\nIn January, Bankman-Fried pleaded not guilty to all counts, which include wire fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and conspiracy to misuse customer funds. He could face up to 115 years in jail if convicted on all charges.\n\nThe crypto industry as a whole suffered from FTX\u2019s collapse, which was the first of many. BlockFi filed for Chapter 11 in November 2022, as did Genesis Global Trading in January.\n\nWhere we are today\n\nBankman-Fried will be represented by Cohen & Gresser, and Mark Cohen, a high-profile defense attorney and former federal prosecutor, will be the lead attorney.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T12:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nI think it\u2019s important for people to think I look crazy.\u201d)\n\nBecause he was so successful at this kind of public relations, his fall from grace was another mark against an industry that was already roiled by bankruptcies and scandals. Some additional trouble for the crypto industry is likely to come from one crucial element of the fraud trial \u2014 the part where the government must prove intent.\n\nThe first part of proving the government\u2019s case is pretty simple and a little boring: prosecutors must show that certain transactions took place. Whatever records the Southern District of New York has for the transactions will be shown.\n\n\u201cWhat conversations happened between him and his co-conspirators that are now cooperating against him?\u201d\n\nThe second part is where all the drama is likely to come, says Christopher LaVigne, a litigation partner and co-chair of the cryptocurrency practice at the law firm Withers. Prosecutors have to connect those transactions to Bankman-Fried, show that he knew what he was doing was wrong, and prove that he lied about it anyway.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: How is it still getting worse for Sam Bankman-Fried?\npublished_at: 2023-10-12T23:08:14+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nNot great!\n\nSam Bankman-Fried, the founder of failed cryptocurrency exchange FTX, is on trial for seven counts of wire fraud and conspiracy. FTX was a fraud \u201cfrom the start,\u201d the Securities and Exchange Commission alleges \u2014 with a \u201cmulti-billion-dollar deficiency caused by his own misappropriation of customer funds.\u201d Follow along for all the latest news and regular updates from the trial.\n\nBut a lot of testimony relied on Ellison recounting conversations she\u2019d had in person, or on auto-deleting text messaging platforms. This gave the defense an opportunity to try to make her sound unreliable. After all, she had an incentive to flip on Bankman-Fried: the possibility of leniency in her sentencing. Given her fun tweets about speed, the fact that she was Bankman-Fried\u2019s ex-girlfriend, and that she\u2019d apparently written a bunch of stuff down, I was expecting fireworks. For the first time in this trial, maybe the defense had an opening.\n\nInstead, I got a sad trombone.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The FTX trial is bigger than Sam Bankman-Fried\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T12:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThat effectively exempted Alameda from the kinds of risk management other customers faced. At the same time, the government alleges, \u201cBankman-Fried publicly and repeatedly asserted that Alameda did not have privileged access to FTX.\u201d\n\nBankman-Fried is accused of using \u201cbillions of dollars in misappropriated FTX customer deposits\u201d to help buy more than $200 million of real estate for himself, make billions of dollars of investments for his own interest, and repay Alameda\u2019s lenders, according to the indictment, Additionally, Bankman-Fried allegedly used more than $100 million of customer funds to make political contributions; prosecutors can show evidence of those contributions in this trial, even though they aren\u2019t part of the charges brought. A second trial is scheduled for March 2024, with additional charges.\n\nBefore his fall, Bankman-Fried made himself out to be the Good Boy of crypto \u2014 the trustworthy face of a sometimes-shady industry.\n-----",

No apartment in New York City has ever sold for close to that amount, James said.\n\nTrump valued Mar-a-Lago as high as $739 million \u2014 more than 10 times a more reasonable estimate of its worth.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBecause of this, New York State arrived at a valuation that was about a third of Trump\u2019s in those years. They haven\u2019t provided a more recent estimate.\n\nSpace inflation wasn\u2019t the only issue. Between 2014 and 2015, Trump increased the value of the apartment to $US327 million from $US200 million. The prosecution argues that was to mask a drop in the value of one of his other properties. \u201cA discrepancy of this order of magnitude, by a real estate developer sizing up his own living space of decades, can only be considered fraud,\u201d Judge Arthur Engoron wrote in a September ruling. \u2018The company has never been stronger and never been better.\u2019 Eric Trump Bloomberg values the property using recent Trump Tower sales, as well as those of comparable Manhattan penthouses. While some splashy residences in much newer buildings on so-called Billionaires Row have listed for well in excess of $US100 million, they typically boast higher ceilings, more up-to-date finishes, contemporary layouts, outdoor space and better views.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBut it\u2019s also likely that the association with Trump would turn off some buyers. Trump Park Avenue Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US90.9 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US86.4 million, New York\u2019s valuation (2021): $US80 million The residential condo tower on Manhattan\u2019s Upper East Side, formerly the Hotel Delmonico, isn\u2019t one of Trump\u2019s best-known buildings, but it\u2019s been the source of some significant asset inflations, according to the prosecution.\n\nIts value to Trump mostly stems from unsold condo units that are owned by the Trump Organisation and rented out. A varying number have been rent-stabilised, meaning tenants pay below market rates. Typically, these apartments are valued at a discount because tenants can stay indefinitely, sometimes even passing them on to children. In 2010, 12 rent-stabilised apartments owned by Trump were valued at an average of $US62,500 each in an appraisal provided by a real estate company.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThousands of pages of exhibits detailing the performance of his assets made available during the trial have provided a deeper look into his fortune. The former president\u2019s 2021 statement of financial condition, filed as part of the lawsuit, pegged his net worth at $US4.5 billion. Bloomberg\u2019s calculation has consistently been below Trump\u2019s figures. At the same time, Bloomberg measured the value of some Trump properties higher than what New York state claims. Trump took the stand and testified that the properties whose values he\u2019s accused of inflating were actually undervalued, based on the premium his \u201cbrand\u201d adds. He also said that banks didn\u2019t rely on his statements of financial condition when weighing loans. \u201cThey just weren\u2019t a very important element in banks\u2019 decision-making process,\u201d Trump told the court. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll explain that as this trial goes along.\u201d Here\u2019s a look at New York state\u2019s valuation of four high-profile Trump properties where the prosecution alleges fraud occurred, along with Bloomberg\u2019s own approach to assessing the assets.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The $777 million surprise: Donald Trump is getting richer\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T22:22:05+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\n40 Wall Street Trump\u2019s valuation (2021): $US664 million, Bloomberg valuation (2023): $US270 million, New York\u2019s valuation: No current estimate available In valuing his flagship lower Manhattan office tower, Trump consistently ignored more conservative appraisals he\u2019d received from professionals, New York State argues. Trump has been accused of significantly over-valuing his flagship downtown New York property. Credit: Bloomberg For example, 40 Wall Street was appraised by a real estate company at $US200 million in 2011 and $US220 million in 2012. Despite this, Trump valued the property in financial statements at $US524.7 million and $US527.2 million, respectively, for those years.\n\nBloomberg uses a capitalisation of net income approach in coming up with an estimate. Valuations for commercial offices across the board have taken a hit in the past 18 months amid rising interest rates and a lacklustre corporate leasing market. But 40 Wall Street has its own unique problems.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T21:11:15+00:00\nsource: Fortune\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n-----",

These have included variations on the \u201cbet-and-get\u201d welcome offers described above. Fanatics has featured a bet $5, get $200 in Bonus Bets offer before. They have also structured the same offer differently by inviting new users to make five bets of at least $10 over five days and receive Bonus Bets each time they do, again totaling $200.\n\nFanatics Sportsbook has also taken advantage of the company\u2019s other major business as an official sports apparel and gear provider that partners with all the major leagues and teams.

Also, the $200 total in Bonus Bets you can receive just for depositing and wagering $5 is the best deal around, and you don\u2019t even have to win or lose your first bet. The deposit match bonus offer is unique as well, although not all new users will likely try to take advantage of it.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Vermont Sportsbook Promos and Sports Betting Launch News\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T22:53:28+00:00\nsource: Sporting News\nExcerpt:\n-----\nCaesars covers wide range of markets and different bet types while also featuring a terrific live betting platform.

As confirmed during a teleconference Wednesday, SBF will be taking the stand, along with a handful of other witnesses as the onus shifts toward the defense after the prosecution brought its case to its conclusion.\n\nAs former federal prosecutor Josh Naftalis told TechCrunch, SBF taking to the stand in his own trial is a \u201cHail Mary\u201d ahead of a verdict and potential sentencing for seven counts tied to fraud and money laundering.\n\n\u201cOnce it goes to cross[-examination], he doesn\u2019t get to say, \u2018I\u2019m done,\u2019\u201d Naftalis said.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: SBF, riding high on FTX, reportedly offered $5B to Trump to cancel President re-run\npublished_at: 2023-10-02T13:11:07+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nCome Tuesday, our eyes will be trained on the Manhattan Federal Court for the trial of Sam Bankman-Fried, the disgraced cryptocurrency entrepreneur accused of orchestrating \u201cone of the biggest financial frauds in American history\u201d: the multibillion-dollar collapse of FTX, the crypto exchange he founded and led.\n\nSBF, as he\u2019s known, has pleaded not-guilty to some seven charges of fraud and conspiracy.

In June, Twitch launched the Partner Plus program, a new monetization tier that would grant eligible creators a 70/30 subscription revenue split on the first $100,000 they make per year. The program further strained its relationship with its community, because the requirements to qualify excluded the vast majority of streamers. Streamers need at least 350 monthly paid subscriptions, and gift subs and monthly subs that come with an Amazon Prime account don\u2019t count.\n\nIn response, Twitch pivoted eligibility to a points-based system, assigning a value to each subscription tier. The higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T22:28:10+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe higher-priced subscriptions now count more toward the point total.\n\n\ud83d\udce3 We\u2019re updating how we calculate progress toward the Partner Plus program.

The company\u2019s receptiveness to community feedback has marginally lessened animosity from its streamers, and community sentiment toward Twitch at this year\u2019s TwitchCon in Las Vegas was significantly more positive than it was last year.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T22:28:10+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIn those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\n\nOne thing we\u2019ve done since the beginning, where we are a leader, is getting people to take their wallets out and support creators through subscriptions, gifting, cheering. I think that sets us as a unique community-based platform where viewers are directly supporting creators in that way.\n\nOther services have tried it but from what I can tell them, what streamers have told me, is that Twitch is really the leader in that way. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on advertising, because there\u2019s no social media, content distribution service in the world that doesn\u2019t rely on advertising as a component. So ads have been a big focus.\n\nAnd the third piece, which is where we\u2019re behind, is sponsorships.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T22:28:10+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nNew features and policy changes announced during the convention\u2019s keynote address, including granting streamers more control over ad breaks and allowing simulcasting to other livestreaming platforms, also appeased the Twitch community.\n\nIn an interview with TechCrunch, Twitch\u2019s Chief Monetization Officer Mike Minton discussed the unpopular policy decisions, supporting smaller creators through branded partnerships and what Twitch is doing to mend its relationship with its community.\n\nTechCrunch: I\u2019m going to start with a maybe unpleasant question, but Twitch has made some unpopular decisions in terms of monetization. Is there anything that Twitch is doing to appease irate creators?\n\nMike Minton: Two years ago, we said we\u2019re no longer gonna do these deals that weren\u2019t objective in terms of eligibility criteria. We ended that program. It affected a relatively small number of creators, but what it really impacted was the community going, \u201cI don\u2019t have anything to work for.\u201d And that led to us recently announcing Partner Plus.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T22:28:10+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt\u2019s a very reliable source of income for many streamers.\n\nSo I think the combination of making it easier to run, increasing the rev share and then recently in the keynote, we talked about two new features to allow moderators to know when an ad break is coming, and adjust the ad break around the content because the problem in livestreaming, as you\u2019re aware, is that people don\u2019t want to miss out. So we\u2019re very focused on improving the ad experience by allowing the ad breaks to be synchronized with the content and enrolling moderations and eventually the community in adjusting those ad breaks.\n\nLike you said, livestreaming is very different from static content, and tactics for monetization that work for Instagram or TikTok just don\u2019t really work for Twitch or any livestreaming platform. In those cases, what has Twitch done differently from those more standard platforms in terms of making monetization more seamless?\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Twitch\u2019s money guy talks about the revenue split controversy and its monetization long game\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T22:28:10+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThere was some feedback saying, \u201cHey, we\u2019re going to need a lot of subs,\u201d and we reacted to it by making it eligible by sub points so that your higher price point subscriptions cost more, and that was actually received quite positively.\n\nBoth Dan and I have said in different forms, that this is the beginning. It\u2019s not the end and we\u2019re going to continue to work to provide access to higher rev shares as we can over time, to more streamers.\n\nWhat would that look like?\n\nThe simple answer is now, 350 was the criteria we established, right? And that number is arbitrary and could easily come down. Now, our target and our goal in this program still remains the same. We\u2019re looking to benefit the creators, where livestreaming is a meaningful part of what they\u2019re doing as a creator. That allows us to focus on those streamers that are really at a point where it will matter most for them in terms of keeping them as a livestreaming creator.\n-----",

He has no desire for it now, and the smell of alcohol almost makes him gag.\n\nDespite a stellar career and a loving family, Bills safety Jordan Poyer \u201cfelt like there was something missing\u201d as recently as last year. (Dan Pompei / The Athletic)\n\nBeing sober didn\u2019t make him immune to anxiety and depression, however. In the 2022 season, he missed five games with elbow, foot, knee and rib injuries. When the Bills lost to the Bengals in the divisional playoff round, Poyer felt responsible for not doing more.\n\nAnd his angst ran deeper than football.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Alcoholism, Ayahuasca and the Enlightenment of an N.F.L.

The needle settled at 179 pounds, about 20 pounds below his playing weight.\n\nAfter resuming his regular routine, the weight came back quickly.\n\nHe discussed his experience with curious teammates, coaches and the team psychologist. Poyer hoped ayahuasca would elevate his football performances as Rodgers believes it did his, but it hasn\u2019t worked that way for him.\n\nHe is the second-leading tackler on his team but hasn\u2019t made as many big plays as he would like. What he has done, according to former Bills defensive coordinator Les Frazier, now an analyst for NFL Network, is enable his defense to be the best it can by lifting others through versatility, sacrifice, toughness and communication.

When Poyer was handed a shot, he looked at it and then at his teammates.\n\nHe put it down.\n\nNorman and the others, who had never seen him turn down a drink, were taken aback.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d one said. \u201cCome on, Deejay Poyo!\u201d\n\nDeejay Poyo was Poyer\u2019s alter ego.

He wants to lift a Lombardi Trophy badly, as much as ever. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, he believes he can handle the disappointment better.\n\nOn Fridays this season, Poyer, fellow safety Taylor Rapp and assistant strength coach Will Greenberg play crystal bowls at Bills headquarters. \u201cThe different tones that you can tune into can enhance chakras within you and help you heal,\u201d he says.\n\nHealing takes many forms.\n\nWhen Poyer was 12, Louis Dunbar, who has done multiple stints in prison for violent crimes, called him for the first time and stunned him with the revelation he was his biological father. In subsequent conversations, Dunbar often said he wanted to see him or come to one of his games. He never has.\n-----",

Instacart, Snap (Snapchat\u2019s parent company) and Quizlet are among its initial customers.\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nMicrosoft launches the new Bing, with ChatGPT built in\n\nAt a press event in Redmond, Washington, Microsoft announced its long-rumored integration of OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4 model into Bing, providing a ChatGPT-like experience within the search engine. The announcement spurred a 10x increase in new downloads for Bing globally, indicating a sizable consumer demand for new AI experiences.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: One year later, ChatGPT is still alive and kicking\npublished_at: 2023-11-30T14:10:43+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\na year ago tonight we were probably just sitting around the office putting the finishing touches on chatgpt before the next morning\u2019s launch. what a year it\u2019s been\u2026 \u2014 Sam Altman (@sama) November 30, 2023\n\nIn the months following its launch, ChatGPT gained paid tiers with additional features, including a plan geared toward enterprise customers. OpenAI also upgraded ChatGPT with web searching, document analyzing and image creating (via DALL-E 3) capabilities. And, leaning on speech recognition, voice synthesis and text-image understanding models developed in house, OpenAI gave ChatGPT the ability to \u201chear,\u201d \u201cspeak,\u201d \u201csee\u201d and take actions.\n\nIndeed, ChatGPT became priority number one at OpenAI \u2014 not simply a one-off product but a development platform to build upon.

Since its initial launch nearly a year ago, ChatGPT has hit 100 million weekly active users, and OpenAI is heavily investing in it.\n\nPrior to the leadership chaos, on November 6, OpenAI held its first developer conference: OpenAI DevDay. During the conference, it announced a slew of updates coming to GPT, including GPT-4 Turbo (super-charged versions of GPT-4, its latest language-writing model), a multimodal API and a GPT store where users can create and monetize their own custom versions of GPT.\n\nGPT-4, which can write more naturally and fluently than previous models, remains largely exclusive to paying ChatGPT users. But you can access GPT-4 for free through Microsoft\u2019s Bing Chat in Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome and Safari web browsers.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: ChatGPT: Everything you need to know about the AI-powered chatbot\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T20:03:39+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nChatGPT can engage with a range of topics, including programming, TV scripts and scientific concepts.

The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nGoogle links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v.

However, with Ireland sent home by the All Blacks in the quarters, the Bokke showed their World Cup mettle to edge the hosts 29-28 at the Stade de France, sneaking past Les Bleus in one of the best games of rugby you're ever likely to see.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: \u2018Biggest win of my career\u2019: De Minaur, Popyrin power Australia into Davis Cup final\npublished_at: 2023-11-24T23:10:22+00:00\nsource: The Age\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe second of Sinner\u2019s Djokovic victories came in Italy\u2019s impressive Davis Cup semi-final triumph over Serbia, after saving three consecutive match points on serve, before besting the world No.1 again in the doubles.

Yes. However, global investment firms know that they need to invest and build their offerings in Japan to meet the growing appetite, and that they need to pay attention to an equity market at a 33-year high.\u201d\n\nTopix, Japan\u2019s main stock index, has risen more than 25 per cent this year, outperforming almost all the world\u2019s developed market indices and, as some conference attendees admit, creating a \u201cfear of missing out\u201d on a rally that may have significantly further to go.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T23:01:09+00:00\nsource: Financial Times\nExcerpt:\n-----\nOne of the most significant changes, say asset managers, is the fundamental shift in the way global funds now look at China. The geopolitics of US-China tensions, chip wars, decoupling and \u201cfriendshoring\u201d seem, in particular, to be working significantly in Japan\u2019s favour. Asia-focused global investment is rotating out of China and into Tokyo stocks, real estate and other assets, just as large parts of corporate Japan are engaging more actively with shareholders than at any time in the past.\n\nChina, after years of stunning growth and investor attention, is very rapidly losing that sheen. Its economy is growing more slowly and the expected post-pandemic rebound is proving elusive. On top of that, Beijing\u2019s policymaking \u2014 with its sudden crackdowns on entire industries, like video games and private tutoring, has generated a series of nasty surprises \u2014 and the unshakeable fear that others could occur at any time.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T23:01:09+00:00\nsource: Financial Times\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cYou are seeing more interest in Japan from investors, who were primarily invested in China, as China has slowed and some of its economic policies have been confusing and opaque,\u201d says Kirk Neureiter, president of Fidelity Management & Research Japan. \u201cDeployment of capital to China has been a bit more risky in terms of eventual outcome of investment decisions, given that lack of clarity.\u201d But interest in Japan has not only come about because of the push away from China, he adds.\n\nJapanese companies are increasingly aligning themselves with the interests of shareholders in a way that once seemed unlikely. Part of that, he says, is generational. Companies that replace their chief executive on five or seven year cycles now have leaders that reached their positions after the establishment of Japan\u2019s stewardship code (in 2014) and corporate governance code (2015). Many have a very different view of the role of a chief executive than their predecessors did.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T23:01:09+00:00\nsource: Financial Times\nExcerpt:\n-----\nLarge global funds are not the only ones to have had their interest in Japan piqued, says Keith Truelove, head of global markets at UBS Securities Japan.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot of dry powder on the sidelines,\u201d he observes. \u201cThere is a lot of interest in Japan from family offices and from high net worth individual investors, who value wealth preservation more highly than institutional investors \u2014 it\u2019s really taking off now.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey took their time to decide if it was safe to invest in Japan again, because they need to get confidence in the idea that the Japan story will be more sustainable this time,\u201d Truelove adds. He notes that Japan has offered investors a number of false-dawns over the years, and the bar for deciding that \u2018this time is different\u2019 remains high.\n\nOne of the most significant changes, say asset managers, is the fundamental shift in the way global funds now look at China.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T23:01:09+00:00\nsource: Financial Times\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cI would urge you to evaluate what we are doing in my country, look at the underlying strength of our economy and our plans for the future and then invest in Japan,\u201d Kishida said in a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York.\n\nOn the face of it, the Tokyo conference guests have been told by various experts that the stars do appear aligned in Japan\u2019s favour, both on its own merits and in comparison with what is happening around it. But, because so many global funds have diverted expertise away from Japan in recent years, they are concerned that they need to know more, as a matter of urgency.\n\n\u201cThere is heightened interest in Japan after what has been, for many, a long period of not being focused on that country,\u201d says Paul Hitchens, the head of the Japan research department at Jefferies, which hosted a major investor conference in Hong Kong.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Japan\u2019s prime minister Kishida says: \u2018reassess our economy\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-10-01T23:01:09+00:00\nsource: Financial Times\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThroughout September, in Tokyo, New York, Hong Kong and London, the world\u2019s biggest investment banks hosted a series of conferences for the world\u2019s biggest investors, all gravitating around the same theme: is Japan really back?\n\nAnd, according to both the attendees and hosts of those events \u2014 which were run by JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Mizuho, BNP Paribas, and Jefferies \u2014 the answer is now clearer than it has been in a very long time. Japan is back, but global investors may take a little more persuasion that it is truly back for the duration.\n\nSo, this week, prime minister Fumio Kishida will make his strongest ever push for a bet on Asia\u2019s biggest advanced economy \u2014 as BlackRock founder Larry Fink, and other heads of global funds, gather in Tokyo for a series of events to attract investment.\n-----",

The EU also said then it was looking at X\u2019s compliance across a number of areas, including policies and practices regarding notices on illegal content, complaint handling, risk assessment and measures to mitigate the risks identified \u2014 and it gave X until the end of October to respond.\n\n\u201cOn the basis of the preliminary investigation conducted so far, including on the basis of an analysis of the risk assessment report submitted by X in September, X\u2019s Transparency report published on 3 November, and X\u2019s replies to a formal request for information, which, among others, concerned the dissemination of illegal content in the context of Hamas\u2019 terrorist attacks against Israel, the Commission has decided to open formal infringement proceedings against X under the Digital Services Act,\u201d the EU said today.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Meta says it\u2019s prioritizing livestreaming checks during Israel-Hamas war\npublished_at: 2023-10-13T12:43:45+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cTo mitigate this, for some violations we are temporarily removing content without strikes, meaning these content removals won\u2019t cause accounts to be disabled,\u201d it notes. \u201cWe also continue to provide tools for users to appeal our decisions if they think we made a mistake.\u201d\n\nCompliance with the bloc\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) kicked in for Meta in August as the owner of a so-called very large online platform (VLOP).\n\nThe Commission designated 19 VLOPs back in April \u2014 including Meta owned Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe designation puts obligations on VLOPs to respond diligently to reports of illegal content, as well as clearly communicate their T&Cs to users and properly enforce their terms. But it also ranges more widely \u2014 requiring these larger platforms to take steps to identify and mitigate systemic risks such as disinformation.\n\nThe regulation also contains a \u201ccrisis response\u201d mechanism which the Commission may adopt on VLOPs in situations where use of their platforms could contribute to serious threats such as war.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: EU fires urgent warning at Elon Musk\u2019s X over illegal content and disinformation following Hamas attacks\npublished_at: 2023-10-10T23:47:38+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cThis is particularly relevant when it comes to violent and terrorist content that appears to circulate on your platform,\u201d Breton continues in another pointed warning.\n\nX should have \u201cproportionate and effective mitigation measures\u201d in place to tackle \u201cthe risks to public security and civic discourse stemming from disinformation,\u201d he also says.\n\nInstead, the platform appears to be turning into an engine of disinformation \u2014 one that\u2019s demonstrably enabled the very swift amplification of a smorgasbord of toxic fakes around the Israel-Hamas war. Falsehoods that may be trying to manipulate opinion around the conflict, or otherwise exploit horrific events to drive engagement (clickbait) or for even more bleak, cynical and potentially harmful ends.\n\n\u201cPublic media and civil society organisations widely report instances of fake and manipulated images and facts circulating on your platform in the EU, such as repurposed old images of unrelated armed conflicts or military footage that actually originated from video games.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: After warning, the EU opens investigation into X over alleged disinformation\npublished_at: 2023-10-13T00:38:56+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nEU turns up the heat on X over illegal content in wake of Israel-Hamas war\n\nThe European Union is cranking up the heat on Elon Musk-owned X. Late Thursday, the Commission sent the company a formal request for more information \u2014 after issuing a public warning Wednesday about reports that illegal content and disinformation targeting the Israel-Hamas war is circulating on the platform, and Twitter\u2019s CEO sending a high-level (non specific) response to that warning.\n\nThe move could prefigure the opening of a formal investigation of X under the bloc\u2019s content moderation rulebook, the Digital Services Act (DSA). If the Commission moves ahead on that, it will be the first investigation opened under the DSA since a compliance deadline for so called \u201cvery large online platforms\u201d (aka VLOPs) kicked in this summer.\n\nNon-compliance under DSA rules, meanwhile, could trigger fines of up to 6% of annual turnover, plus potential blocking of a service for repeated infringements.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: EU fires urgent warning at Elon Musk\u2019s X over illegal content and disinformation following Hamas attacks\npublished_at: 2023-10-10T23:47:38+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIn a very swift test of the European Union\u2019s newly updated content moderation rulebook, the bloc has fired a public warning at Elon Musk\u2013owned X (formerly Twitter) for failing to tackle illegal content circulating on the platform in the wake of Saturday\u2019s deadly attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists based in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe European Commission has also raised concerns about the spread of disinformation on X related to the terrorist attacks and their aftermath.\n\nUnlike terrorism content, disinformation is not illegal in the EU per se. However, the EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA) puts an obligation on X \u2014 as a so-called very large online platform \u2014 to mitigate risks attached to harmful falsehoods as well as to act diligently on reports of illegal content.\n\nFollowing the terrorist attacks by Hamas against \ud83c\uddee\ud83c\uddf1, we have indications of X/Twitter being used to disseminate illegal content & disinformation in the EU.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Meta says it\u2019s prioritizing livestreaming checks during Israel-Hamas war\npublished_at: 2023-10-13T12:43:45+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAlthough this aspect of the regulation won\u2019t start operating until early next year (Feburary 17) as it requires an advisory body, called the European Board for Digital Services, to be operational so it can recommend the Commission to adopt a crisis response mechanism (and the set up of the Board is waiting on Member States to establish national Digital Services Coordinators, aka the bodies that will oversee DSA compliance for non-VLOPs).\n\nPenalties for failing to comply with the pan-EU regulation can reach as high as 6% of global annual turnover \u2014 which, in Meta\u2019s case, could run to multiple billions.\n\nThe social media giant is not alone in being warned by the bloc over content concerns attached to the Israel-Hamas war: Elon Musk\u2019s X has been singled out for even greater attention here \u2014 with the bloc issuing both an \u201curgent\u201d warning earlier this week and following that with a formal request for information about its compliance approach.\n\nTikTok has also received a warning from the EU about DSA content risks related to the conflict.\n-----",

Unbeknownst to him, Chewy was running a discount promotion, and dropped the price of his product by a few dollars to $39.99 \u2013 less than the $43 offer on Amazon. The algorithm had flagged it as a lower offer, even though the item on Chewy cost $48.54 after shipping and taxes. Ruckel had to make a choice: Lower the price on Amazon or ask Chewy to raise the price of his product. He opted for the latter.\n\nFred Ruckel's company Snuggly Cat makes Ripple Rug, an interactive play mat for cats.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T21:31:00+00:00\nsource: Cnbc | World Business News Leader\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAt that time, he said, \"I would have felt, yes Amazon is a monopoly\u2026 But actually after Covid, into 2023, ecommerce has had a lot of big changes.\u201d He added, \"The competition is just not what it was in 2019.\" Competitors like Shopify and Walmart are increasingly viable alternatives for many categories of sellers, Needham said, not to mention rapidly growing Chinese e=commerce companies like Temu. As a result, Needham said he\u2019s seen some significant changes from Amazon. Among those is a greater ability for Amazon sellers to communicate with buyers, offering select customers certain promotions. Shopify, for example, gives sellers much more control over how they communicate with customers, Needham said, adding that although Amazon still controls the communication process, at least there is one. \"I wish it was a clear-cut case,\u201d Needham said. \u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T21:31:00+00:00\nsource: Cnbc | World Business News Leader\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cI have a vested interest in the marketplace doing really well, as a seller and as a service provider. And... this case, it doesn\u2019t make the marketplace better for sellers.\"\n\nConcerns over Amazon pricing policies, fees\n\nMany sellers have zeroed in on Amazon\u2019s pricing policies and rising fees as rightful areas of concern in the FTC's lawsuit. Molson Hart, whose company Viahart sells toys on Amazon, has been a longtime critic of Amazon\u2019s pricing policies. Hart complained of how Amazon\u2019s seller fees impact pricing in a 2019 Medium post and later that year testified about his experience before a House committee. Hart said Amazon sales comprise about 90% of his business, meaning any hit those sales take on Amazon has a considerable impact. He recalled \u201c24 anxious hours\u201d in September 2022 when a third-party seller of his popular construction toy Brain Flakes listed the toy for a lower price on Target than it was offered on Amazon.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T21:31:00+00:00\nsource: Cnbc | World Business News Leader\nExcerpt:\n-----\nFor many, using FBA doesn\u2019t feel like a requirement, but they believe using it will make their businesses \"easier and more effective.\" \"I think that the power that Amazon wields over sellers is considerable and absolutely worth looking into,\u201d Needham said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not sure if this would actually change that.\u201d Scott Moller, an Amazon seller and co-founder of an agency that helps merchants run their storefronts, said the e-commerce giant has removed some of the challenges that used to be part of running an online business.

Amazon\u2019s software had detected that Ruckel\u2019s popular cat toy, called the Ripple Rug, was being sold somewhere else for a cheaper price. His product would no longer be shown in Amazon\u2019s all-important buy box, an area of the listing where shoppers click \u201cAdd to Cart.\u201d Ruckel is the sole seller of the Ripple Rug on Amazon, so the move all but ensured his product would disappear from the website, costing him thousands of dollars per day.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Amazon sellers sound off on the FTC's 'long-overdue' antitrust case\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T21:31:00+00:00\nsource: Cnbc | World Business News Leader\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cI don\u2019t have to have my own warehouse,\u201d said Moller, who sells grilling accessories on Amazon under the brand Grill Sergeant. \u201cI can use their staff, their storage, and I can instantly also take the data of advertising, so I can target ads.\u201d He also disputed the FTC\u2019s claim that Amazon has become littered with ads in search results, causing shoppers to wade through potentially less-relevant products of lesser quality. \u201cWe can tailor our ads to hit exactly the consumers we want,\u201d Moller said. \u201cIt\u2019s a perfect marriage of a transaction, and that\u2019s one of the beauties of what their marketplace offers.\u201d Needham said he feels he would have been more supportive of the case if it were filed a few years ago, pre-pandemic.\n-----",

She\u2019s done extensive (and fascinating) research around how certain sites have fared under these new guidelines: Urban Dictionary, down! Mayo Clinic, up! Some people consider EEAT part of what\u2019s making results better than ever. Others see it as a form of censorship, disproportionately affecting right-wing perspectives. Not every search query takes EEAT into account; Google has described heightened concern over sites that could impact safety, happiness, and the ability to be an informed citizen. But the point that really hit me was that for certain kinds of information, Google had undone one of the fundamental elements of what had made its results so appealing from the start.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The people who ruined the internet\npublished_at: 2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIn 2009, Sullivan was described as \u201cthe closest approximation to an umpire in the search world,\u201d so when he published \u201cA deep look at Google\u2019s biggest-ever search quality crisis\u201d in 2017 and then took a job as Google\u2019s public liaison for Search only a few months later, it felt to some SEOs as though a congressperson working on gun safety legislation had quit to become an NRA lobbyist.\n\n\u201cThere is a thread across the industry of people who believe that Google just made Danny an offer he couldn\u2019t say no to, and it was designed essentially to take his voice out of the conversation,\u201d Forrester told me. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the case,\u201d he went on, but compared to Cutts, \u201cI think that Danny specifically stays out of a lot of public conversations because he is in those private conversations with businesses.\u201d\n\nWas all that really Google\u2019s fault? Or the SEOs? Or was this about something deeper and more human: the will to exploit something so much we destroy it.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The people who ruined the internet\npublished_at: 2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nFor the past 25 years, the internet as we know it has been almost entirely defined and controlled by Google. What the SEOs do matters for all of us on a daily basis, distorting how we perceive the world in ways we can hardly begin to imagine or understand. Yet any money that any SEO has made is a fraction of a crumb compared to Google\u2019s 10-layer cake. The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities. As Google\u2019s founders wrote back in 1997: \u201cwe expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why most countries around the world have libraries that are public institutions: information that is controlled by a private business will always be subject to that business\u2019s bottom line. In the beginning, the internet was seen as an improvement on the spirit of the public library.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The people who ruined the internet\npublished_at: 2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWho the hell are these people making money off of everyone else\u2019s misery?\n\nAfter all, a lot of folks are unhappy, in 2023, with their ability to find information on the internet, which, for almost everyone, means the quality of Google Search results. The links that pop up when they go looking for answers online, they say, are \u201cabsolutely unusable\u201d; \u201cgarbage\u201d; and \u201ca nightmare\u201d because \u201ca lot of the content doesn\u2019t feel authentic.\u201d Some blame Google itself, asserting that an all-powerful, all-seeing, trillion-dollar corporation with a 90 percent market share for online search is corrupting our access to the truth. But others blame the people I wanted to see in Florida, the ones who engage in the mysterious art of search engine optimization, or SEO.\n\nDoing SEO is less straightforward than buying the advertising space labeled \u201cSponsored\u201d above organic search results; it\u2019s more like the Wizard of Oz projecting his voice to magnify his authority.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The people who ruined the internet\npublished_at: 2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nNow, instead of wild-west crowdsourcing, search was often reinforcing institutional authority.\n\nYou can\u2019t just be the most powerful observer in the world for two decades and not deeply warp what you are looking at\n\nThis felt complicated at best. When it comes to health and wellness, for example, quackery is often in the eye of the beholder. Everyone knows someone who has struggled with the limits of Western medicine. So much of the original draw of the internet was the opportunity for outlier voices to be heard alongside established experts and elites. Looking back on all that had changed around what first attracted people to Google, from the introduction of ads to the efforts to keep users within the universe of Google products, this seemed to be the last straw.\n\nThe second major reason why Google results feel different lately was, of course, SEO \u2014 specifically, the obnoxious-kid-refusing-to-behave-in-class kind of SEO.\n\n\u201cSEO that goes against Google\u2019s guidelines, it\u2019s not new,\u201d Ray explained.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The people who ruined the internet\npublished_at: 2023-11-01T13:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cAs companies get big, it gets harder to get things done. Inevitably, people start to think about profit or quarterly numbers.\u201d He claimed that, at least while he was there, search quality always came before financial goals, but he believes that the public underestimates how Google is shaping what they see, saying, \u201cI deeply, deeply, deeply believe search engines are newspaper-like entities, making editorial decisions.\u201d He speculated that the company didn\u2019t want the public to think too hard about how search works because that awareness \u201cencourages regulators and makes people realize, \u2018Oh, there\u2019s a lot of money here.\u2019\u201d\n\nThere has always been advertising and polemics from cranks, scammers, and liars. But now we see this stuff surfacing alongside truth, and we can\u2019t tell the difference. We move through our lives with a greater sense of distrust and fear and insecurity. At the end of the day, it\u2019s Google\u2019s world, and the SEOs are only living in it.\n-----",

And it\u2019s depressing to think that my mum is in so few of our family photos because she was always the person on the other side of the camera.\n\nA decent Bluetooth-enabled tripod can resolve these issues.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The best deals on MacBooks right now\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T18:17:19+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAs for the base 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M3 Pro (12-core CPU / 18-core GPU), 18GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD, it\u2019s selling for $2,249 ($250 off) at Amazon and B&H Photo.\n\nM2 Pro MacBook Pro\n\nAs for the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros from early 2023 with M2 Pro / Max processors, they\u2019re still more than capable \u2014 they may even be a better buy than the new models if you can find them at a steep discount.\n\nFor example, the base 14-inch MacBook Pro with an M2 Pro chip, a 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM is selling for $1,629 ($370 off) at Amazon, which is a new low price that may not last very long.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The best deals on MacBooks right now\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T18:17:19+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBut if you want to buy new and you\u2019re looking to save whatever you can, here are the best MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini deals available right now.\n\nA note about discounted Intel-based Macs At this point, we don\u2019t recommend buying any older Intel-based Macs. Retailers may try to tempt you with very low prices on leftover new or refurbished stock, but there\u2019s a reason nobody wants them anymore. They\u2019re completely outclassed by all the newer models, unless you have some super-niche Windows Boot Camp needs \u2014 and even then, consider what Windows apps you really need and if they work with Parallels.\n\nThe best MacBook Air deals\n\nM1 MacBook Air\n\nThe MacBook Air is Apple\u2019s entry-level laptop. It\u2019s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, an excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The best deals on MacBooks right now\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T18:17:19+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nApple sells MacBooks equipped with its own M-series chips in a wide range of sizes and price points. The offerings start with the 13-inch MacBook Air from 2020 at $999 and go all the way up to the latest 16-inch MacBook Pro starting at $2,499. But finding a deal on a current Mac with an M1, M2, or even the new M3 chip \u2014 as well as the higher-end M3 Pro and M3 Max \u2014 is actually not that difficult.\n\nWhile Macs may not experience perpetual discounts, it\u2019s not uncommon to see various current models discounted by as much as $400. Alternatively, purchasing refurbished options directly from Apple is another way to save money without as much waiting for the changing winds of deals to blow your way. Apple\u2019s refurbished store provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally offers discounts of up to 15 to 20 percent off the price of a new unit.\n-----",

The max frequency of both the GPU and CPU are identical between the LCD and OLED models, so for developers tuning their games for Steam Decks, they only have a single performance target.\n\nIn concert with the more-efficient processor, there\u2019s also a 25 percent larger battery with a 50Whr capacity, compared to the original\u2019s 40Whr. According to Valve, these changes combined result in a 30-50 percent increase in longevity between the two generations \u2014 the official battery life claim is \"three to 12 hours.\" In our review, we measured a playtime increase of 62 percent when playing Hades on the OLED model versus our 18-month-old original. (Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The Steam Deck OLED arrives November 16 with an improved screen and longer battery life\npublished_at: 2023-11-09T18:00:32+00:00\nsource: Engadget\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWe imagine stocks will not last very long, as it looks pretty rad:\n\nValve\n\nWhile there are no concrete updates on future hardware developments, Valve engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais noted that, so long as interest in handheld gaming remains high, the company has \"plans for successive generations of handhelds.\" For now, Griffais explained, it's important to Valve that developers don't need to \"split their attention\" between different performance targets.\n\nWhen asked about the potential for future hardware \u2014 like a return of the Steam Machine or an updated Steam Controller \u2014 there were no firm updates, but there does seem to be something happening. Griffais agreed that enabling the Steam Deck to work as a hybrid living room console was a \"side goal\" of the team, and noted that everything Valve does to improve SteamOS will benefit other devices. Coomer added that Valve is still working internally on \"a bunch of controllers and prototypes.\"\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The Steam Deck OLED improves much more than its screen\npublished_at: 2023-11-09T18:00:00+00:00\nsource: Polygon\nExcerpt:\n-----\nI got so distracted pulverizing bad dudes that it took me some time to notice the Steam Deck OLED\u2019s most welcome feat. When playing AAA games on the original Steam Deck, I had always kept the handheld plugged into an outlet. But with the OLED model, a couple of hours had passed before I realized I\u2019d forgotten to connect the charger.\n\nThe OLED screen makes for a fancier Steam Deck, but it\u2019s the battery life (and some tweaks throughout the design to carve out more of it) that lets Valve\u2019s new handheld truly deliver on its promise of a portable gaming PC.\n\nAll the tiny, delightful improvements of Steam Deck OLED\n\nSince the original Steam Deck launched, Valve has been improving the hardware through updates \u2014 its team estimates around 300 to date. That will continue with both the Steam Deck OLED and the original Steam Deck, the latter of which will get a fresh BIOS update to align itself with some of the former\u2019s upgrades. The original device will see some battery life improvement; just don\u2019t expect the OLED model\u2019s jump of 30-50%.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The Steam Deck OLED improves much more than its screen\npublished_at: 2023-11-09T18:00:00+00:00\nsource: Polygon\nExcerpt:\n-----\nYes. But you might find that the screen and the battery justify the double dip. For someone like me, who puts hundreds of hours into the Steam Deck each year, the upgrade is inescapable.\n\nAnd if you don\u2019t have a Steam Deck? How many times can I say it: This is my favorite console ever. And it just got better.\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED will be available Nov. 16 to purchase through the Steam storefront. The hardware was reviewed with a unit provided by Valve. Vox Media has affiliate partnerships.

Valve has announced a new Steam Deck and \u2014 double surprise \u2014 we\u2019ve already reviewed it. It might not look like a big change from the outside, but the Steam Deck OLED is a thorough mid-cycle refresh of a machine that\u2019s not even two years old. At the same time, Valve is also adjusting the configuration of its entry-level model, making it a far more compelling option. Apologies to anyone who literally bought a Steam Deck yesterday.\n\nAt an event held for press prior to the device's launch, Greg Coomer, a product designer at Valve, called the new model \"the definitive version of the Steam Deck.\" He explained that the device contains many things the company wanted to include at the LCD model's launch but wasn't able to, along with some additions based on community feedback.\n\nAs its name suggests, the most noticeable upgrade to the Steam Deck OLED is the display. The original Steam Deck had a 7-inch 800p LCD running at 60Hz.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The Steam Deck OLED arrives November 16 with an improved screen and longer battery life\npublished_at: 2023-11-09T18:00:32+00:00\nsource: Engadget\nExcerpt:\n-----\n(Batteries degrade over time, which explains why our gains were more pronounced.)\n\nThe new internals make the Steam Deck OLED marginally lighter, and also cooler to the touch when playing games, aided by a slightly larger fan. Other improvements include support for both Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3, together with a new antenna array that will give a better experience when using both at the same time. There\u2019s also a reworked power supply (it has a logo now!) with a longer 2.5m cable that will charge the OLED model from 20 to 80 percent in \u201cas little as 45 minutes.\u201d The thumbsticks have also been made 1mm taller, and the touch pads' haptics are slightly sharper.\n\nValve\n\nThe Steam Deck OLED starts at $549, and will replace all but the entry-level model in the range.\n-----",

Speaking to the publication, she said she connected with Kelce in July, after he confessed on his podcast that he tried and failed to give her a friendship bracelet with his phone number on it during one of her Eras Tour shows.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Taylor Swift reveals secret start to her relationship with Travis Kelce\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T14:23:01+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nHave adventures.

I\u2019m more trusting now than I was six years ago.\u201d\n\nWith his love life in the public eye, Kelce has also opened up about his relationship with Swift. In an interview withWSJ Magazine, published on 20 November, he described how much he admires her skills as a musician. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a man of words. Being around her, seeing how smart Taylor is, has been f***ing mind-blowing. I\u2019m learning every day,\u201d he explained.\n\nHowever, he also acknowledged the heavy public attention around his private life as a result of his relationship, noting he\u2019s \u201cnever dated anyone with that kind of aura around them\u201d. But, according to Kelce, he\u2019s not letting the media affect his relationship.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, I\u2019m not running away from any of it,\u201d he said.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Taylor Swift reveals secret start to her relationship with Travis Kelce\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T14:23:01+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cThis all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I\u2019m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other.\u201d\n\nSwift also confirmed that when she famously first attended Kelce\u2019s game at Arrowhead Stadium in September, she was already dating the NFL star.\n\n\u201cBy the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date,\u201d she said.\n\nThe \u201cBlank Space\u201d singer also acknowledged that although her love life continues to make headlines with every Kansas City Chiefs game she attends, she\u2019s focused on being there for her partner. She specified that she isn\u2019t trying to hide her relationship from the public eye.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Taylor Swift reveals secret start to her relationship with Travis Kelce\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T14:23:01+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe \u201cAll Too Well\u201d singer\u2019s interview with Time marks her first time publicly speaking out about Kelce, who she\u2019s been romantically linked to since this summer, when the football tight end first confessed to attempting to give her his number.\n\nWhile Swift has attended a few of Kelce\u2019s games since their relationship started, he\u2019s also gone on to support her career. In November, he made his way to Buenos Aires, Argentina, to attend one of her Eras Tour shows. During the concert, Swift gave a shout-out to the Chiefs player when she changed her \u201cKarma\u201d lyrics to reflect their relationship. \u201cKarma is the guy on the Chiefs, coming straight home to me,\u201d she sang, letting out a laugh as fans in the audience screamed in response.\n\nAfter the show, the \u201cStyle\u201d singer was seen running into Kelce\u2019s arms and kissing him, before he whisked her away backstage.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Taylor Swift reveals secret start to her relationship with Travis Kelce\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T14:23:01+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAfter the show, the \u201cStyle\u201d singer was seen running into Kelce\u2019s arms and kissing him, before he whisked her away backstage.\n\nElsewhere in the conversation with Time, the \u201cAnti-Hero\u201d singer said that she tries not to let the paparazzi get to her, even though so many of her outings with pals go on to make headlines. \u201cOver the years, I\u2019ve learned I don\u2019t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don\u2019t matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there\u2019s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends,\u201d she said.\n\nShe emphasised how her perspective about the media has changed over the years, adding: \u201cLife is short. Have adventures.

And we\u2019re just proud of each other.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview with Time, the Grammy winner addressed how her appearances at Kelce\u2019s games are heavily publicised. So far, she\u2019s attended five of Kelce\u2019s games, including one on 3 December, and she\u2019s often seated in the Kelce family suite during the events.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don\u2019t know where it is, and you have no idea when the camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being shown 17 times or once,\u201d she said.\n-----",

Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nA new class action lawsuit filed this week in the U.S. District Court in D.C. accuses Google and parent company Alphabet of anticompetitive behavior in violation of U.S. antitrust law, the Sherman Act, and others, on behalf of news publishers. The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nPublishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference.

You may be feeling some d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu!\n\nAfter all, didn\u2019t Epic already go to trial with Apple, resulting in a ruling where Apple (mostly) won? Didn\u2019t Epic fail to #FreeFortnite with its Llamacorn legal gambit? Didn\u2019t that all happen years ago? What are we doing here again?\n\nThe short answer: while Epic\u2019s antitrust claims against Apple got their day in court, a similar lawsuit against Google never did. On November 6th, Epic v. Google will finally go to trial... a mere 1,180 days after Epic originally sued.\n\nHi, I\u2019m Sean, and I\u2019ll be your guide to this whole delightful mess.\n\nUpdate, December 15th, 2023: It\u2019s basically over now.

Google allegedly even toyed with the idea of buying Epic to keep Fortnite from inspiring other game developers to abandon ship.\n\nPlus, there\u2019s evidence Google deleted potentially incriminating messages to keep them out of a court\u2019s hands. Enough that the judge has decided to explicitly tell the jury we\u2019re not seeing all the evidence, because Google employees all the way up to CEO Sundar Pichai were caught setting those conversations to auto-delete.

The Google outcome could also have a ripple effect on other Big Tech cases. The FTC sued Amazon in September for using anticompetitive and unfair strategies to illegally maintain its monopoly power. The DOJ has been investigating Apple for years over the company\u2019s policy for third-party apps on its devices and whether it unfairly favors its own products. There\u2019s an ongoing case between the FTC and Facebook, wherein the agency calls on Facebook to sell Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThis isn\u2019t Google\u2019s only antitrust case in trial right now. The search engine giant last week settled a separate antitrust lawsuit with dating site Match Group. On November 6, Google went to trial with Fortnite maker Epic Games.

Sales in North America fell 2% from the year-ago period to $5.42 billion, just above the $5.39 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nIn Europe, the Middle East and Africa, sales were up 8% at $3.61 billion. That compared with the $3.51 billion analysts had expected. Sales in its Latin America and Asia Pacific unit came in 2% higher at $1.57 billion, just shy of the $1.59 billion analysts had expected, according to StreetAccount.\n\nThe Converse brand, on the other hand, fell well short of expectations for a second quarter in a row.

With the resumption of student loan payments looming ahead, some analysts expect those sectors to take an even greater hit.\n\nJefferies conducted a survey on U.S. consumer spending and found 54% of respondents plan to spend less on apparel and accessories.

In June, the company noticed that shoppers were shifting towards its stores over its digital channels, signaling consumers are getting closer to pre-pandemic shopping habits.\n\n\"We continue to see that consumers want to connect directly and personally with our brands and in fact, member engagement within our direct business is up double digits versus the prior year with increasing average order values,\" said Friend.\n\n\"Our stores delivered an especially strong quarter with traffic up double digits from last year, and members driving an increasing share of our business as consumers shifted from our digital to physical channels...

With no single partner representing more than a mid-single digit of Nike's total business,\" said Friend.\n\n\"While the ultimate landing spot of digital and direct isn't as clear, we do believe we're going to be a more direct and a more digital company, and a more profitable company,\" he said. \"And there's a channel mix and channel profitability opportunity that comes with that as well.\"\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Nike misses revenue expectations for the first time in two years, beats on earnings and gross margin\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T20:31:00+00:00\nsource: Cnbc | World Business News Leader\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWhen it comes to its wholesale revenues, Nike's relationship with those partners have been rocky. As the company has pivoted to a direct-to-consumer model, it has focused on driving sales online and in its stores at the expense of its wholesale accounts.\n\nHowever, as Nike grappled with excess inventories throughout 2023, it relied on those partners to move through that merchandise. It has now restored its relationship with both Macy's and DSW \u2013 accounts that it previously cut in favor of its DTC strategy.\n\nSome analysts expected Nike's wholesale revenue to be sluggish during the quarter because excess inventories have been a problem throughout the retail industry \u2013 and some wholesalers are being more particular in what they order to avoid another backlog.\n\nWholesale revenue during the quarter was flat compared to the year-ago period at $7 billion.\n\nBoth Donahoe and Friend made it clear to analysts that Nike is ready to meet customers in all channels \u2014 including through wholesalers and directly.\n-----",

The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nPublishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nGoogle links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n\nHelena World Chronicle, LLC v.

For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-----",

Now a panel of judges has ruled that more than 80 cases can be consolidated into federal court.\n\nThe stakes are high for both parties with implications extending to future Uber riders and drivers. The outcome of the case could result in sweeping changes to Uber\u2019s platform, which plaintiffs argue will reduce sexual assault and also raise new concerns over privacy.\n\nThe upshot? Technology lies at the center of this very human story.\n\nUber has attempted to address sexual assaults by drivers \u2014 which the lawsuits claim Uber has known about since 2014 \u2014 through new safety features in its app, like a 911 button and the ability to share location with a friend. Yet survivors, and their attorneys, say that response has been inadequate, and they\u2019re calling for better technological solutions like in-vehicle surveillance cameras.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T17:03:41+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIn the third quarter, Uber saw total bookings rise from $29.1 billion to $35.3 billion, a gain of around 21%. In business segment terms, Uber generated $17.9 billion in ride-hailing bookings (+31% year over year), and $16.1 billion worth of delivery bookings (+18%). Those key business groups at the company generated $5.1 billion and $2.9 billion in revenue, respectively, during the September quarter.\n\nThere\u2019s nuance to the revenue figures that we need to consider as the rule-changes in question do affect startups that operate in related categories. On the ride-hailing front, Uber told its investors that its Q3 2023 revenue was \u201cnegatively impacted by business model changes in some countries that classified certain sales and marketing costs as contra revenue by $161 million.\u201d That was not the only legal change that led to Uber\u2019s results changing shape.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T17:03:41+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nUber reported third-quarter earnings on Tuesday that show a profitable ride-hail and delivery company that\u2019s chugging along in spite of slowing growth in some sectors.\n\nThe company reported revenue of $9.3 billion, an 11% increase year over year. Investors had expected Uber to report revenues of around $9.5 billion (FactSet, Refinitiv), meaning that despite the company\u2019s growth, it fell short of estimates. Turning to profitability, Uber reported net income of $221 million in the third quarter, or 10 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $1.2 billion, or 61 cents per share, in the same quarter last year. Again, the company fell short of expectations that it would generate 12 cents in per-share profit.\n\nLooking ahead, Uber anticipates gross bookings of $36.5 billion to $37.5 billion, up just 6% at the top-end from its Q3 result.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T17:03:41+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nFreight falls\n\nOne area that continues to drag on Uber is its freight business.\n\nWhile Uber\u2019s ride-hailing and delivery business saw an uptick in gross bookings in the third quarter, Uber Freight experienced a 27% drop year-over-year. Revenue, as a result, had a similar fall.\n\nThe business unit reported revenue of $1.3 billion in the third quarter, a 27% drop from the same period last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Uber Freight had a 1% gain in revenue.\n\nThe results don\u2019t get any better once we turn to net income. On an adjusted basis, Uber Freight lost $13 million in the third quarter compared to a $1 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nUber said the dismal year-over-year revenue results for its freight business was driven by lower revenue per load and volume. Both are consequences of the challenging freight market cycle.\n\nUber Freight isn\u2019t alone.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T17:03:41+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAfter reporting, shares of Uber are up 1.6% in trading, after an up-and-down morning of shares exchange.\n\nAgainst a backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, the former startup darling\u2019s results can be viewed as an indication that its business model has matured and is now in a stable, profitable and cash-generating position. On the other hand, under-performing demand results from a company as global as Uber could indicate that consumer spend is coming in lighter than anticipated.\n\nFor startups in the transport and on-demand sectors, Uber\u2019s earnings are a regular informational zeitgeist. So let\u2019s work to understand where Uber\u2019s revenue came from in the third quarter, and how each of its top-line sources converted \u2014 or not \u2014 to bottom-line results.\n\nWhere did the money come from?\n\nIn the third quarter, Uber saw total bookings rise from $29.1 billion to $35.3 billion, a gain of around 21%.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Uber\u2019s Q3 numbers include impressive profitability gains, slower-than-expected growth\npublished_at: 2023-11-07T17:03:41+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBoth are consequences of the challenging freight market cycle.\n\nUber Freight isn\u2019t alone. Other more recent entrants to the freight and logistics industry such as Flexport and Convoy have struggled this year. In Convoy\u2019s case, the business was forced to shut down with its assets gobbled up by Flexport.\n\nUber Freight continues to plug along, despite these economic headwinds. The question is whether Uber believes in the long-term income potential of freight.\n\nSo what?\n\nWhen discussing Uber\u2019s results internally, our vibe was that it is a very profitable and healthy company today, albeit one that is not growing as fast as the market had hoped. The fact that Uber\u2019s share price is up as we write this indicates that investors are content thus far to excuse the small Q3 misses and keep their eyes more focused on its year-over-year improvements and forward guidance. More when we get Lyft\u2019s numbers.\n-----",

Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cThe anticompetitive effects of Google\u2019s scheme cause profound harm to competition, to consumers, to labor, and to a democratic free press,\u201d reads an announcement posted to the website of the law firm handling the case, Hausfeld.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff Helena World Chronicle, LLC invokes the Sherman Act and Clayton Act to seek class-wide monetary and injunctive relief to restore and ensure competition for digital news and reference publishing and set up guardrails to preserve a free marketplace of ideas in the new era of artificial intelligence,\u201d it states.\n\nA Google spokesperson offered a statement on the lawsuit, saying \u201cThis lawsuit is meritless. People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results.

The case, filed by Arkansas-based publisher Helena World Chronicle, argues that Google \u201csiphons off\u201d news publishers\u2019 content, their readers and ad revenue through anticompetitive means. It also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nPublishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals.\n-----",

But like any newer technology, large companies tend to move cautiously. Throughout this year, as vendors feverishly announced new generative AI-fueled products, CIOs took note.\n\nSome companies have actually been looking to cut back on spending, or at least stay even, not necessarily looking for new ways to spend money. The big exception is when technology enables companies to operate more efficiently, and do more with less.\n\nGenerative AI certainly has the potential to do that, but it also has its own costs associated with it, whether it\u2019s a higher cost for these features in a SaaS product or the price for hitting a large language model API if you\u2019re building your own software internally.\n\nEither way, it\u2019s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T18:45:09+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nEither way, it\u2019s important for the folks implementing the technology to understand if they are getting a return on their investment. A July Morgan Stanley survey of large company CIOs found that many were proceeding cautiously, with 56% of respondents reporting that generative AI was having an impact on their investment priorities, but only 4% had actually launched significant projects. In fact, most were still in the evaluation or proof of concept phase. This may be a fast moving area, but it fits with what we\u2019re hearing in conversations with CIOs as well.\n\nThat said, much like the consumerization of IT a decade ago, CIOs are under pressure to deliver the kind of experiences people are seeing when they play with ChatGPT online, says Jon Turow, a partner at Madrona Ventures.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s undeniable that enterprise employees, who are the internal customers of the CIO or CTO, have all tried ChatGPT and they know what amazing looks like.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T18:45:09+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThey know where it\u2019s early, and they know where it\u2019s inspiring, and for lack of a better word, where they see greatness. And so CIOs are under pressure to deliver that level,\u201d Turow told TechCrunch.\n\nIt has created a tension between this desire to please the internal customers, especially when some of that pressure could be coming from the CEO, and a CIO\u2019s natural tendency to move cautiously, even with something as potentially transformative as generative AI. That\u2019s going to take setting up some structure and organization around how this gets implemented over time, says Jim Rowan, principal at Deloitte, who is working with clients around how to build generative AI across companies in an organized fashion.\n\n\u201cA lot of the way we\u2019re working with companies is thinking about what is the infrastructure that they need to be successful.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T18:45:09+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAs companies hear about the potential power of generative AI, it\u2019s only natural that they would want to learn more about it and put it to work to help their organizations run more efficiently, but at the same time, executives are right to be somewhat cautious, recognizing that these are still early days and they have to learn through experimentation if this is truly transformative technology.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T18:45:09+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nSharon Mandell, CIO at Juniper Networks, says that her company is participating in an initial pilot with Microsoft around Copilot for Office 365, and anecdotally, she has heard a range of feedback from people who love it to those who are less impressed, but she says trying to measure increased productivity remains a challenge, even with Microsoft beginning to provide dashboards that at least show the level of adoption and usage.\n\n\u201cThe hard thing about this is you don\u2019t have data on people\u2019s level of productivity. So no matter what, you\u2019re using somewhat anecdotal information until you get really good at understanding these dashboards from Microsoft showing you how people are using it,\u201d she said.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: When it comes to generative AI in the enterprise, CIOs are taking it slow\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T18:45:09+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cA lot of the way we\u2019re working with companies is thinking about what is the infrastructure that they need to be successful. By infrastructure, I don\u2019t necessarily mean technology, but who are the people, what are the processes and the governance\u2026and giving them the capabilities to set that up,\u201d Rowan said. A big part of that is talking about use cases and how to use the technology to address a given problem.\n\nThis is in line with how CIOs we spoke to are approaching implementing this in their organizations. Monica Caldas, CIO at insurance company Liberty Mutual, started with a few-thousand-person proof of concept, and is looking for ways to expand that for her 45,000 employee company.\n\n\u201cWe know generative AI will continue to play a critical role in virtually every part of our company, so we\u2019re investing in many use cases to further develop and refine them in service of supporting our employees and giving them better internal capabilities,\u201d she said.\n-----",

A big part of your growth narrative when you went public, it was mentioned many times in the prospectus, for example, was this joint venture you had with Tencent in China.

We\u2019re, in a sense, modernizing our infrastructure to the point where we can literally print a copy of Roblox in China and bring it to market there. So we continue to be very involved in China. We\u2019re optimistic about it. We have a great partnership with Tencent, but we\u2019re working on the infrastructure to support that.\n\nWhat does that mean, \u201can autonomous version\u201d of Roblox?\n\nI think as you would look at any other platform or any other social media-type company, we would look back over the last three to four years and see less and less information going back and forth between the US and China to the point where I think the future will be very little goes back, for example, in a China situation.\n\nSo you haven\u2019t given up on China?\n\nAbsolutely not.

You\u2019ve probably seen it: it was created by the venture capitalist Andrew Parker, and it compares a few dozen startups with subsections of Craigslist. Back then, Craigslist was all things to all people online, and a generation of startups figured they could do part of the job a lot better.\n\nSome of those companies failed \u2014 sometimes because of Craigslist! \u2014 but some also became gigantically successful. Airbnb worked because it was more searchable, reliable, and trustworthy than a random Craigslist listing; StubHub sold you secondhand tickets without the 50 percent chance those tickets were fake; Etsy offered a much more fun shopping and discovery experience than a bunch of text listings and crappy photos.\n\nFor a decade, startups tried to unbundle Craigslist. Now they can do the same for social networks.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Tim Sweeney on Epic\u2019s victory royale over Google\npublished_at: 2023-12-12T19:17:14+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt\u2019s interesting to me that because Google distributes the Android operating system as open source, they had to put all these deals out in the open. More out in the open, I should say \u2014 certainly they still wanted to keep them secret.\n\nBut I\u2019m going down my story about all the best emails from the Epic v. Apple trial \u2014 and we do have a lot of documents from both Apple and Google that show they were similarly self-serving in terms of deals.\n\nI\u2019d say this is the thing that\u2019s disappointed me the most with Apple and Google: even at the peak of the antitrust trial against Microsoft, Microsoft was awesome to developers. Microsoft has always been awesome to developers, always being respectful, giving developers a great deal and treating them as partners, you know? And so even as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent. [Editor\u2019s note: Netscape might feel differently.]\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Tim Sweeney on Epic\u2019s victory royale over Google\npublished_at: 2023-12-12T19:17:14+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nAnd so even as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent. [Editor\u2019s note: Netscape might feel differently.]\n\n\u201cEven as Microsoft was crushing corporate competitors, the developer experience was excellent.\u201d\n\nGoogle and Apple both treat developers as adversaries \u2014 they try to attack our revenue streams and prevent us from competing with their products. They\u2019ve built these massive self-preferencing schemes all around excluding developers and disadvantaging third-party developers. I think this is very shortsighted. I think any tech company \u2014 Apple, Google included \u2014 would be much better off in the long term if they viewed developers as awesome partners and did everything they could to support them and empower them and not get in their way financially.\n\nAnd this has been our philosophy with Unreal Engine, for example, and the Epic Games Store. We just want to be a cool partner that helps other companies succeed the way we do. And I think philosophy change... perhaps it will only come with a generational change in the company\u2019s management.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Tim Sweeney on Epic\u2019s victory royale over Google\npublished_at: 2023-12-12T19:17:14+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThey agreed to sign this deal, and they were gleeful about the fact they dissuaded perhaps their number one competitor at the time from launching their own store.\n\nFour years later, Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard \u2014 and one of the big talking points from Microsoft to the European Union was that the merger strengthened the company overall in order to provide a viable computing store on iOS and Android.\n\nWhat would you say the differences are between the Apple and Google cases?\n\nI would say Apple was ice and Google was fire.\n\nThe thing with Apple is all of their antitrust trickery is internal to the company. They use their store, their payments, they force developers to all have the same terms, they force OEMs and carriers to all have the same terms.\n\nWhereas Google, to achieve things with Android, they were going around and paying off game developers, dozens of game developers, to not compete.\n-----",

People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nPublishers also can\u2019t block SGE because it uses the same web crawler as Google\u2019s general search service, GoogleBot.\n\nPlus, it says Google\u2019s Bard AI was trained on a dataset that included \u201cnews, magazine and digital publications,\u201d citing both a 2023 report from the News Media Alliance and a Washington Post article about AI training data for reference. (The Post, which worked with researchers at the Allen Institute for AI, had found that News and Media sites were the third largest category of AI training data.)\n\nThe case points to other concerns, too, like changing AdSense rates and evidence of improper spoliation of evidence on Google\u2019s part, by its destruction of chat messages \u2014 an issue raised in the recent Epic Games lawsuit against Google over app store antitrust issues, which Epic won.\n\nIn addition to damages, the suit is asking for an injunction that would require Google to obtain consent from publishers to use their website data to train its general artificial intelligence products including Google\u2019s own and those of rivals.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThis could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content.\n-----",

Trump\u2019s figure for the private club and residence was based on the idea that the property could be developed for residential use, but deed terms prohibit that, James said.\n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing, arguing in sworn testimony for the case that it didn\u2019t matter what he put on his financial statements because they have a disclaimer that says they shouldn\u2019t be trusted. He told James at the April deposition, \u201cYou don\u2019t have a case and you should drop this case.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know the banks were fully paid?

Trump has long insisted he did nothing wrong.\n\nThe decision, days before the start of a non-jury trial in Attorney General Letitia James\u2019 lawsuit, is the strongest repudiation yet of Trump\u2019s carefully coiffed image as a wealthy and shrewd real estate mogul turned political powerhouse.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T21:11:15+00:00\nsource: Fortune\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe Trump Organization was convicted of tax fraud last year in an unrelated criminal case for helping executives dodge taxes on extravagant perks such as Manhattan apartments and luxury cars. The company was fined $1.6 million. One of the executives, Trump\u2019s longtime finance chief Allen Weisselberg, pleaded guilty and served five months in jail. He is a defendant in James\u2019 lawsuit and gave sworn deposition testimony for the case in May.\n\nJames\u2019 lawsuit does not carry the potential of prison time, but could complicate his ability to transact real estate deals. It could also stain his legacy as a developer.\n\nJames has asked Engoron to ban Trump and his three eldest children from ever again running a company based New York. She also wants Trump and the Trump Organization barred from entering into commercial real estate acquisitions for five years, among other sanctions. The $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T21:11:15+00:00\nsource: Fortune\nExcerpt:\n-----\nEngoron\u2019s ruling, in a phase of the case known as summary judgment, resolves the key claim in James\u2019 lawsuit, but six others remain.\n\nEngoron is slated to hold a non-jury trial starting Oct. 2 before deciding on those claims and any punishments he may impose. James is seeking $250 million in penalties and a ban on Trump doing business in New York, his home state. The trial could last into December, Engoron has said.\n\nTrump\u2019s lawyers had asked the judge to throw out the case, which he denied. They contend that James wasn\u2019t legally allowed to file the lawsuit because there isn\u2019t any evidence that the public was harmed by Trump\u2019s actions. They also argued that many of the allegations in the lawsuit were barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nEngoron, noting that he had \u201cemphatically rejected\u201d those arguments earlier in the case, equated them to the \u201ctime-loop in the film \u2018Groundhog Day.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Donald Trump defrauded banks with 'fantasy' to build his real estate empire, judge rules in a major repudiation against the former president\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T21:11:15+00:00\nsource: Fortune\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe $250 million in penalties she is seeking is the estimated worth of benefits derived from the alleged fraud, she said.\n\nJames, who campaigned for office as a Trump critic and watchdog, started scrutinizing his business practices in March 2019 after his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen testified to Congress that Trump exaggerated his wealth on financial statements provided to Deutsche Bank while trying to obtain financing to buy the NFL\u2019s Buffalo Bills.\n\nJames\u2019 office previously sued Trump for misusing his own charitable foundation to further his political and business interests. Trump was ordered to pay $2 million to an array of charities as a fine and the charity, the Trump Foundation, was shut down.\n-----",

In many crypto networks, if someone lost enough money, the exchanges could stick other traders with the losses too. FTX touted its automated liquidation as a way to avoid this, so that one customer going bankrupt wouldn\u2019t affect the others.\n\nFTX lied about how much money was in the backstop fund\n\nIn the process of liquidating, FTX would try to sell the collateral on the open market, but if it couldn\u2019t finish, then backstop liquidity providers would step in. These were market makers, including Alameda, which could be compensated for the losses they take from a \u201cbackstop fund,\u201d Wang said.\n\nBut FTX lied about how much money was in the backstop fund, Wang said. In court we saw the code that generated the fake number published on the website: it took the daily trading volume on FTX, multiplied it by a random number, divided it by a billion, and added it to the existing number displayed on the site.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: In the end, the FTX trial was about the friends screwed along the way\npublished_at: 2023-10-26T12:00:00+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThen, it was okay to take even more. First, it was a little line of credit just to provide liquidity. Then a bigger one. Then an effectively limitless one.\n\nEllison testified to something similar, choking back tears: \u201cWhen I started working at Alameda, I don\u2019t think I would have believed you if you told me I would be sending false balance sheets to our lenders or taking customer money, but over time, it was something I became more comfortable with.\u201d\n\nEllison\u2019s tenure as CEO of Alameda Research was an exercise in optics, she testified. Alameda Research was, by then, FTX\u2019s sin-eater. When FTX took a loss in the hundreds of million dollars because a trader had exploited its system, Wang moved that loss onto Alameda\u2019s balance sheet. FTX\u2019s \u201cinsurance fund,\u201d meant to keep traders from getting stuck with other traders\u2019 losses, was totally made up \u2014 Alameda simply picked up the tab.\n\nEven that wasn\u2019t good enough.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T22:21:46+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nFirst it was \u201ca few hundred million,\u201d then a billion, then even that wasn\u2019t enough. It wasn\u2019t clear how Wang arrived at $65 billion specifically, but he said he\u2019d discussed the number with Bankman-Fried. Other customers didn\u2019t have the same privileges.\n\nAlameda also allegedly kept FTX from looking bad by assuming some of its losses. In 2021, FTX was facing a \u201cseveral hundred million dollar\u201d loss from an exploit in MobileCoin, Wang said. (This seems to have happened in April 2021, though Wang didn\u2019t give a month.) Bankman-Fried directed him to have Alameda take it on instead, because FTX\u2019s balance sheets were visible to investors and Alameda\u2019s weren\u2019t.\n\nYesterday, Paradigm Capital\u2019s Matt Huang showed us the balance sheets he received from Bankman-Fried.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T22:21:46+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nLiquidation is a way for FTX to manage risk when people were engaging in risky bets on its platform. The cartoon version of futures trading is this: a futures exchange is the middleman that lets strangers bet with each other. It lives between the two ends of the bet, paying the winner and collecting from the loser. If the loser doesn\u2019t pay up, the exchange still has to pay the winner, which is why exchanges require collateral.\n\nUnder some circumstances, exchanges will automatically sell collateral to limit their losses. On FTX, this process was automated, Wang testified. It took about 30 seconds to find accounts that needed to be liquidated to minimize FTX\u2019s losses.\n\nNormal customers \u2014 the defense objected to \u201cnormal\u201d but was overruled \u2014 could be automatically liquidated, but not Alameda. Bankman-Fried \u201ctold me a few times to make sure that Alameda\u2019s account is never liquidated on FTX,\u201d Wang said.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Today the FTX jury suffered through a code review\npublished_at: 2023-10-06T22:21:46+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nMeanwhile, Wang supervised the code behind a key prosecution claim: that Alameda Research was afforded secret, special privileges with FTX\u2019s funds. When FTX went down, Wang left himself with no plausible deniability. I cannot for the life of me understand why.\n\nNormal customers \u2014 the defense objected to \u201cnormal\u201d but was overruled \u2014 could be automatically liquidated\n\nToday, the prosecution grilled Wang on a single, damning column in FTX\u2019s databases. Called \u201callow_negative,\u201d it allowed Alameda to have a negative balance. Alameda could withdraw money even when its accounts didn\u2019t have any, and it had an enormous line of credit. Wang added that it could place orders faster than other users, and we already saw evidence that users may have unwittingly deposited money into Alameda rather than FTX.\n\nThe alleged motivation for this \u2014 as Wang had to explain at painful length to a jury \u2014 was avoiding liquidation. Liquidation is a way for FTX to manage risk when people were engaging in risky bets on its platform.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The jury finally hears from Sam Bankman-Fried\npublished_at: 2023-10-28T00:12:41+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBut Bankman-Fried testified that in 2020, the \u201crisk engine was effectively sagging under the weight\u201d of the exchange\u2019s rapid growth. So its time to liquidation went up \u2014 it took minutes to determine which accounts needed to be liquidated. As a result, at one point the risk engine got stuck in a catastrophic feedback loop that would have created losses in the \u201ctrillions of dollars,\u201d Bankman-Fried testified. As part of that feedback loop, Alameda teetered on the brink of liquidation, which \u201cwould have disastrous consequences\u201d for FTX.\n\n\u201cAt the time, I wasn\u2019t entirely sure what was happening.\u201d\n\nBecause of that experience, Bankman-Fried suggested an \u201calert\u201d or \u201cdelay\u201d that would keep Alameda from being liquidated by a bug. This is the supposed origin story of \u201callow_negative,\u201d which Bankman-Fried says was the eventual result of that conversation, and that he says he didn\u2019t know about until very recently.\n\nThere is a problem with this story.\n-----",

The Reveal After OpenAI received another $US2 billion from Microsoft, Altman and another senior executive, Greg Brockman, visited Bill Gates at his sprawling mansion on the shores of Lake Washington, outside Seattle.

Researchers inside OpenAI, Google and other companies thought this rapidly improving technology could be a path to AGI. But Amodei was unhappy about the Microsoft deal because he thought it was taking OpenAI in a really commercial direction.\n-----",

The company brings in hundreds of billions of dollars a year, profits that skew Google\u2019s choices and priorities.

EV batteries were another target. \u201cThey get rid of them,\u201d Trump said, according to Discourse Blog, \u201cand lots of bad things happen, and when they\u2019re digging it out of the ground to make those batteries, it\u2019s going to be very bad for the environment.\u201d But those trying to protect the environment by promoting EVs are \u201cenvironmental lunatics,\u201d he said.\n\nHis comments were the latest attempt to make electric vehicles a major wedge issue in American politics. President Joe Biden has made EVs a major part of his environmental legacy, and Trump senses that the issue could be used to leach support from working-class voters.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T16:37:13+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBut right now, most of the work on electric vehicles is being done by non-union labor. And experts say that needs to change in order for opinions to soften.\n\n\u201cWhat this industry narrative about UAW\u2019s demands costing too much alongside the EV transition seems to neglect is the fact that auto companies are getting billions of dollars from taxpayer-funded EV subsidies to make it work,\u201d Sydney Ghazarian, an organizer with the climate-focused Labor Network for Sustainability, said on the Citations Needed podcast recently. \u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good, you know, and central to that is not leaving workers and communities behind in the transition to a green economy.\u201d\n\nGhazarian argued that Trump and the GOP\u2019s attacks on EVs smacks of \u201cfaux populism\u201d since Republicans largely stand opposed to unionization. When he was president, Trump appointed anti-union judges and anti-union members to the National Labor Relations Board.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T16:37:13+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWhat\u2019s clear, though, is that union members aren\u2019t really buying what either party is selling. Workers may agree with Trump that EVs are too expensive or that the charging infrastructure isn\u2019t up to snuff, but they also don\u2019t want to see it stopped dead in its tracks. They also have concerns about Biden\u2019s efforts to accelerate EV production by providing incentives to automakers to retrofit factories and to car buyers through generous tax credits.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of people that are frustrated, just with all of them,\u201d Aaron Westaway, a UAW member from outside Detroit, told E&E News. \u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\n\nThe concerns among union workers reflect the attitudes of most Americans, writ large. According to Pew Research, 50 percent of US adults say they are unlikely to buy an EV, while 38 percent said they were likely to consider a battery-powered vehicle. Concerns about charging and range are at the top of the list.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: The small and affordable EVs we lost in 2023\npublished_at: 2023-12-19T15:08:55+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nHere we\u2019ll take a look at the small and low(er)-priced EVs that didn\u2019t make it \u2014 the flops, the failures to launch, the u-turns and holdouts of North America\u2019s size- and range-obsessed EV market.\n\nElectraMeccanica Solo\n\nLegally a motorcycle, ElectraMeccanica\u2019s tiny EV featured one seat, 100 miles of range and an $18,500 price tag. The automaker pitched the three-wheeled vehicle to city dwellers and delivery fleet managers alike. I never got to drive a Solo, but I sat inside one of these cuties last year and found it claustrophobic with the doors shut.\n\nIn April, ElectraMeccanica recalled every Solo over power failure issues. At the time, the company said it was pivoting to four-wheeled vehicles. ElectraMeccanica soon entered into a plan to merge with electric truck maker Tevva.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T16:37:13+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nConcerns about charging and range are at the top of the list. But environmental concerns also rank high, with many people saying they would consider an EV as a way to reduce carbon emissions.\n\nWhat often goes unsaid about autoworkers and their attitudes about EVs is where the money is flowing. And right now, much of it is going to factories and plants outside their strongholds in the Midwest. Ford is building a massive battery plant in Tennessee, for example, as a joint venture with Korean battery maker SK Innovation. Meanwhile, workers at a General Motors joint venture battery plant in Ohio overwhelmingly voted in favor of unionizing under the UAW late last year, in a major win for the union.\n\n\u201cNobody\u2019s happy with Trump, nobody\u2019s happy with Biden.\u201d\n\nIf more factories follow their lead, and more of the EV transition is being meted out on the union\u2019s terms, it\u2019s likely worker attitudes will shift in favor of electrification.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Trump and the GOP are trying to drive a wedge between autoworkers and EVs\npublished_at: 2023-09-28T16:37:13+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nWhen he was president, Trump appointed anti-union judges and anti-union members to the National Labor Relations Board. Trump\u2019s Supreme Court judges also issued rulings that were devastating to public sector unions. And his promises to prevent auto factories from shutting down largely failed.\n\nStill, Biden has his work cut out for him as he seeks to shore up support among working-class families. Biden became the first modern president to visit a picket line this week when he stood alongside striking UAW members in Wayne County, Michigan. Biden told workers they \u201cdeserve a significant raise,\u201d citing the record profits made by the Big Three automakers, Ford, GM, and Stellantis.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to use public funding in ways that serve the public and planetary good\u201d\n\nBut his efforts to frame the EV transition as good for workers as it will be for the environment is still a work in progress.\n-----",

The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n-----",

The creation of the doll is part of the toy company\u2019s \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Mattel slammed for \u2018inaccurate\u2019 Cherokee Barbie\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T18:25:33+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nRegina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn\u2019t think the doll looks like Mankiller. Mattel should have considered traditional pucker toe moccasins, instead of black shoes, and included symbols on the basket that Cherokees use to tell a story, she said.\n\n\u201cWilma\u2019s name is the only thing Cherokee on that box,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cNothing about that doll is Wilma, nothing.\u201d\n\nFollowing the release of the doll in November, Hoskin had issued a statement to express how meaningful the creation was to the Cherokee Nation.\n\n\u201cWhen Native girls see it, they can achieve it, and Wilma Mankiller has shown countless young women to be fearless and speak up for Indigenous and human rights. She not only served in a role dominated by men during a time that tribal nations were suppressed, but she led,\u201d he said. \u201cWilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Mattel slammed for \u2018inaccurate\u2019 Cherokee Barbie\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T18:25:33+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\n\u201cWilma Mankiller is a champion for the Cherokee Nation, for Indian Country, and even my own daughter. She truly exemplifies leadership, culture and equality and we applaud Mattel for commemorating her in the Barbie Inspiring Women Series.\u201d\n\nMankiller, whose likeness is on a US quarter issued in 2021, is the second Native American woman honoured with a Barbie doll. Famed aviator Bessie Coleman, who was of Black and Cherokee ancestry, was depicted earlier this year. Other dolls in the \u201cInspiring Women\u201d series include Maya Angelou, Ida B Wells, Jane Goodall and Madam CJ Walker.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Mattel slammed for \u2018inaccurate\u2019 Cherokee Barbie\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T18:25:33+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nMattel spokesperson Devin Tucker said the company is aware of the problem with the syllabary and is \u201cdiscussing options\u201d. The company worked with Mankiller\u2019s estate, which is led by her husband, Charlie Soap, and her friend, Kristina Kiehl, on the creation of the doll.\n\nSome Cherokee women were also critical of the doll, with claims that Mattel overlooked the problematic details on the doll and the packaging.\n\n\u201cMixed emotions shared by me and many other Cherokee women who have now purchased the product revolve around whether a Wilma Barbie captures her legacy, her physical features and the importance of centering Cherokee women in decision making,\u201d Stacy Leeds, the law school dean at Arizona State University and a former Cherokee Nation Supreme Court justice, told The Associated Press in an email.\n\nRegina Thompson, a Cherokee basket weaver who grew up near Tahlequah, doesn\u2019t think the doll looks like Mankiller.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Mattel slammed for \u2018inaccurate\u2019 Cherokee Barbie\npublished_at: 2023-12-06T18:25:33+00:00\nsource: The Independent - Life and Style\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThe toy also comes with a basket, with her look inspired by an iconic photo of Mankiller where she\u2019s holding a woven basket.\n\nHowever, Mattel has now faced some criticism over the doll, with people calling the toy company out for inaccuracies. Chuck Hoskin Jr, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, noted to The New York Times that the doll\u2019s basket wasn\u2019t authentically Cherokee. He also specified that the wrong sets of symbols used for the Cherokee language were included in the packaging of the doll. As a result, the symbols on the package read \u201cChicken Nation\u201d as opposed to Cherokee Nation\u201d.\n\n\u201cTo someone who doesn\u2019t read Cherokee syllabary, they\u2019re not going to notice it,\u201d he said.\n-----",

People have many ways to access information and news content today \u2013 through publishers\u2019 websites, dedicated apps, social media platforms, print papers and more. Google links people to publishers\u2019 websites more than 24 billion times each month \u2013 at no cost to them.\u201d\n\nThe complaint is available below.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt also specifically cites new AI technologies like Google\u2019s Search Generative Experience (SGE) and Bard AI chatbot as worsening the problem.\n\nIn the complaint, Helena World Chronicle, which owns and publishes two weekly newspapers in Arkansas, argues that Google is \u201cstarving the free press\u201d by sharing publishers\u2019 content on Google, losing them \u201cbillions of dollars.\u201d\n\nIn addition to new AI technologies, the suit points to Google\u2019s older question-and-answer technologies, like the \u201cKnowledge Graph\u201d launched in May 2012, as part of the problem.\n\n\u201cWhen a user searches for information on a topic, Google displays a \u2018Knowledge Panel\u2019 to the right of the search results. This panel contains a summary of content drawn from the Knowledge Graph database,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cGoogle compiled this massive database by extracting information from Publishers\u2019 websites \u2014 what Google calls \u2018materials shared across the web\u2019 \u2014and from \u2018open source and licensed databases,'\u201d it says.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nIt also asks Google to allow publishers who opt out of SGE to still show up in Google search results, among other things.\n\nThe U.S. lawsuit follows an agreement Google reached last month with the Canadian government which would see the search giant paying Canadian media for use of their content. Under the terms of the deal, Google will provide $73.5 million (100 million Canadian dollars) every year to news organizations in the country, with funds distributed based on the news outlets\u2019 headcount. Negotiations with Meta are still unresolved, though Meta began blocking news in Canada in August, in light of the pressure to pay for the content under the new Canadian law.\n\nThe case also arrives alongside the filing of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s lawsuit against Google for monopolizing digital ad technologies, and references the 2020 Justice Department\u2019s civil antitrust suit over search and search advertising (which are different markets from digital ad technologies in the more recent suit).\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nThis could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nSome publishers are now trying to get ahead of the problem. For example, Axel Springer just this week inked a deal with OpenAI to license its news for AI model training. But overall, publishers believe they\u2019ll lose somewhere between 20-40% of their website traffic when Google\u2019s AI products fully roll out, The WSJ\u2019s report noted.\n\nThe lawsuit reiterates this concern, claiming that Google\u2019s recent advances in AI-based search were implemented with \u201cthe goal of discouraging end-users from visiting the websites of Class members who are part of the digital news and publishing line of commerce.\u201d\n\nSGE, it argues, offers web searchers a way to seek information in a conversational mode, but ultimately keeps users in Google\u2019s \u201cwalled garden\u201d as it \u201cplagiarizes\u201d their content.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: Apple defends Google Search deal in court: \u2018There wasn\u2019t a valid alternative\u2019\npublished_at: 2023-09-26T17:01:22+00:00\nsource: The Verge\nExcerpt:\n-----\nCue was on the stand as a witness in US v. Google, the landmark antitrust trial over Google\u2019s search business. Cue is one of the highest-profile witnesses in the case so far, in part because the deal between Google and Apple \u2014 which makes Google the default search engine on all Apple devices and pays Apple billions of dollars a year \u2014 is central to the US Department of Justice\u2019s case against Google.\n\nCue had two messages: Apple believes in protecting its users\u2019 privacy, and it also believes in Google. Whether those two statements can be simultaneously true became the question of the day.\n\nApple is in court because of something called the Information Services Agreement, or ISA: a deal that makes Google\u2019s search engine the default on Apple\u2019s products. The ISA has been in place since 2002, but Cue was responsible for negotiating its current iteration with Google CEO Sundar Pichai in 2016. In testimony today, the Justice Department grilled Cue about the specifics of the deal.\n-------------------[Excerpt from document]\ntitle: News publisher files class action antitrust suit against Google, citing AI\u2019s harms to their bottom line\npublished_at: 2023-12-15T17:56:02+00:00\nsource: TechCrunch\nExcerpt:\n-----\nBy 2020, the Knowledge Graph had grown to 500 billion facts about 5 billion entities. But much of the \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d that Google tapped into was content \u201cmisappropriated from Publishers,\u201d the complaint alleges.\n\nOther Google technologies, like \u201cFeatured Snippets\u201d where Google algorithmically extracts answers from webpages, were also cited as shifting traffic away from publishers\u2019 websites.\n\nMore importantly, perhaps, is the suit\u2019s tackling of how AI will impact publishers\u2019 businesses. The problem was recently detailed in a report on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, which led with a shocking statistic. When online magazine The Atlantic modeled what would happen if Google integrated AI into search, it found that 75% of the time the AI would answer the user\u2019s query without requiring a click-through to its website, losing it traffic. This could have a major impact on publishers\u2019 traffic going forward, as Google today drives nearly 40% of their traffic, according to data from Similarweb.\n-----",
